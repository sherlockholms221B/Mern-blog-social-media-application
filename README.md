## Introduction
Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I have created a Full fleged MERN Application - from start to finish. The App is called "BLOG" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives, like and comment on posts. With the ability to edith the post you have created, delete the post and full authentication functionality.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
